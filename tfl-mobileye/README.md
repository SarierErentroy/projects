run the Controller module, to start the simulation

####the project include 4 phases

1. Detect light sources candidates
Input: * Current frame - one png image output: * candidates - vector of N positions * auxiliary – vector of N colors {green, red}

2. Calculate candidate probability and decide if is a traffic light using neural net
inputs: * Current frame - one png image * candidates - output from Part 1 * auxiliary – output from Part 1

outputs: * TrafficLights - vector of K positions notice K <= N * auxiliary – vector of K colors

3. Find distance of the traffic lights
input: * Previous and current frames - two png images * Two vectors of TrafficLights positions – from Part 2 * Two auxiliary vectors – from Part 2 * EM matrix, Principal point, focal length output: * Distance – vector of K lengthes of traffic lights

4. integration of th previous parts
